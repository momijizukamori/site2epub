### Downloading
1. Open https://github.com/momijizukamori/site2epub/tree/master/web-ext-artifacts
2. Click on the extension for the site you want - each site has a different extension.
3. Because this is a compressed file, Github will not show the contents by default. Click on the download button, and you'll get a standard browser download prompt for the zip.
